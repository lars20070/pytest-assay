# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:
    ```
    .cursor/rules/
    ├── general.mdc
    ├── another-rule.mdc
    └── ...
    ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
    - Use kebab-case for rule file names
    - Always use .mdc extension
    - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:
    ```
    PROJECT_ROOT/
    ├── .cursor/
    │   └── rules/
    │       ├── general.mdc
    │       ├── another-rule.mdc
    │       └── ...
    └── ...
    ```

4. Never place rule files:
    - In the project root
    - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
    - In any other location

5. Cursor rules have the following structure:

````
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: ["optional/path/pattern/**/*"]
alwaysApply: false
---
# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:
```python
# Good example
def good_example():
    # Implementation following guidelines
    pass

# Bad example
def bad_example():
    # Implementation not following guidelines
    pass
```
